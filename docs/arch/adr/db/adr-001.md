# What DB are we going to use?

## Context

Building the mongodb repo will take time - is there an alternative which satisfies the requirements?

## Decision

An in-memory dictionary

## Justification

Its about the fastest thing that can be implemented that still meets the majority of NFR's. We can afford to sacrifice partition tolerance for delivery speed so long as there is a plan in place to implement partition tolerance later.

Other NFR's are impacted by CAP theorem - we arent bothered about CAP since we arent partition tolerant!

## Status

ACCEPTED
