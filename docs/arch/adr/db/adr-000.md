# What DB are we going to use?

## Context

We need to store viewing session state somewhere. Storage should be persistent, favour availability over consistency, partition tolerant and support multiple connections.

It does not need to be ACID safe.

## Decision

MongoDB

## Justification

MongoDB meets the requirements above and easy to support in production. It can scale once deployed without significant impact to consumers.

Its fast to develop against!

## Status

ACCEPTED
