# How are we going to the host the application?

## Context

We need to host the application. The provider should be easy to deploy to (ideally via script or tooling), be transportable, and easily operable.

## Decision

Docker container

## Justification

'Dockerising' the application means we can implement infrastructure as code. we can also deploy afferent resources as part of this deployment via script.

## Status

ACCEPTED
